## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties ðŸ”¥

Dragon is a community-built product from inception. It is divided into separate data-modules that each visualize any kind of deception or power concentration in a token project. The first four modules produce analyses on bundles, snipes, clusters, and basic security. Soon there will be many more modules that analyze other holder and deception metrics, crowd-sourced by the builders who can think of them.
