## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties, Gain Influence in the Project

Dragon is an open-sourced initiative for discovering alpha as defined by composable and specific token data analyses. The analyses are packaged as community-developed **data modules** that can be incorporated into the extension and selected by users to customize their Dragon.

The initial release is divided into four prototype modules that analyze aspects of MEV activity and holder distributions of a token. These are **Bundles, Snipers, Clusters, and Fundamental Security**. Future modules can analyze other types of MEV, other aspects of a holder distribution, or explore any other token data that a developer can imagine, sourcing intelligence from on- or off-chain.

Please consider contributing to the project by building one of the four bounties pinned below. We are taking new proposals for modules via the Discussions tab of this GitHub (for now).
