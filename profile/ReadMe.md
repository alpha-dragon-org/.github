## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties ðŸ”¥

Dragon is open sourced at release. The goal is to develop all potential analyses on a token that traders will find useful in the trenches.   

The release has been divided into four modules that are specifically focused on the MEV activity and holder distributions of a token. These analyses are on **Bundles, Snipers, Clusters, and Fundamental Security**. Future modules will analyze other types of MEV, different holder distributions, or explore token data not yet categorized.

Please consider joining the project by contributing to one of the bounties below. Community proposals for future modules and categories coming soon.
