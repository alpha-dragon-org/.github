## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties ðŸ”¥

Dragon is open sourced from its release. The goal is to develop all potential analyses on a token that traders will find useful in the trenches.   

The initial release has been divided into four modules,  specifically focused on MEV activity and holder distributions of a token project. These initial analyses are on **Bundles, Snipers, Clusters, and Fundamental Security**. Future modules can analyze other types of MEV, different holder distributions, or explore token data that we have not yet analyzed.

Please consider joining the project by contributing to one of its bounties below. Community proposals for future modules are coming soon.
