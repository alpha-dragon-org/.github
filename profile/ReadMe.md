## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties ðŸ”¥

Dragon is a community build project from inception. The idea is to make data about a token's holders more transparent and compelling with visualizations. The initial release has been divided into four data-modules, each focused on a specific deception or concentration of power in a token: bundles, snipes, clusters, and basics. Soon there will be more modules that analyze more metrics, developed by builders who can think of them.
