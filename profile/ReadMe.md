## Build Modules, Earn $Alpha, Develop Dragon

ðŸ§¿ **Dragon's vision**: for everyday traders to discover alpha as composable data sourced by open intelligence.

ðŸ§© **Data modules**: community-developed token analyses that can be toggled into a user's browser extension.

Please read about the project in its entirety [here](https://alpha-dragon.ai/alphadragon.pdf).

The prototype is divided into four modules that analyze aspects of MEV activity and holder distributions in a token. Please contribute to one of the four bounties pinned below to get started. 

Other module ideas can be proposed in the Discussions tab [here](https://github.com/orgs/alpha-dragon-org/discussions).
