## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties ðŸ”¥

Dragon will be community-built from inception. The goal is to make token holder data more transparent through compelling visualizations. The initial release has been divided into four data-modules, each focused on a specific deception or power concentration in a token: bundles, snipes, clusters, and basics. Soon there will be more modules that analyze other holder metrics, open-sourced by the builders who can think of them.
