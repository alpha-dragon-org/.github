## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties, Gain Influence

Dragon is an open-sourced initiative for discovering alpha as defined by composable and knowledge specific token data analyses. We are packaging these token analyses as **data modules** to be incorporated into the extension and are community-developed.

The initial release is divided into four prototype modules analyzing aspects of MEV activity and holder distributions of a token. The specific analyses are **Bundles, Snipers, Clusters, and Fundamental Security**. Future modules can analyze other types of MEV, other aspects of a holder distribution, or explore any other token analysis a developer can imagine, sourcing data from on- or off-chain.

Please consider contributing to the project by building one of the four bounties pinned below. We are taking initial proposals for modules via the Discussion tab of this GitHub üëáüèº
