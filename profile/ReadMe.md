## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties

Dragon is an open sourced browser extension for trading crypto. The goal is to develop all potential analyses on a token that traders will find useful in the trenches.   

The first release has been divided into modules that are specifically focused on MEV activity and holder distributions of a token. These first analyses are **Bundles, Snipers, Clusters, and Fundamental Security**. Future modules will analyze other types of MEV, other holder distributions, and explore other kinds of token data we haven't even thought about yet.

Please consider joining the project by contributing to one of the bounties below. Community proposals for future modules and future categories are coming soon.
