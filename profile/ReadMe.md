## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties ðŸ”¥

Dragon is a community build project from inception. The idea is to make the data about a token's holders more transparent and compelling.   

The initial release has been divided into four data-modules, each focused on a specific deception or concentration of power in a token: **bundles, snipes, clusters, and security basics**. Soon there will be modules that analyze more metrics, developed by our team of builders who can think of them.   

Please consider joining the team by contributing to one of the current bounties, pinned below.
