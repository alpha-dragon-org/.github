## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties ðŸ”¥

Dragon is a community build project from inception. The goal is to make token holder data more transparent through compelling visualizations. The initial release has been divided into four data-modules, each focused on a specific deception or power concentration in a token: bundles, snipes, clusters, and basics. Soon there will be more modules that analyze other metrics, developed by the builders who can think of them.
