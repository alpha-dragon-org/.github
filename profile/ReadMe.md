## Build Dragon, Collect Bounties ðŸ”¥

Dragon is open sourced browser extension for trading crypto. The goal is to develop all potential analyses on a token that traders will find useful in the trenches.   

The release has been divided into modules that are specifically focused on the MEV activity and holder distributions of a token. These analyses are **Bundles, Snipers, Clusters, and Fundamental Security**. Future modules will analyze other types of MEV, different holder distributions, and explore token data we haven't thought about yet.

Please consider joining the project by contributing to one of its bounties below. Community proposals for future modules and categories are coming soon.
