## Build Modules, Earn Bounties, Own Dragon

ðŸ§¿ **Dragon's vision**: for everyday traders to discover alpha as composable data sourced by open intelligence.

ðŸ§© **Data modules**: community-developed token analyses that can be toggled into a user's browser extension.

ðŸ¤“ Please read about the project in its entirety [here](https://alpha-dragon.ai/alphadragon.pdf).

This prototype is divided into four modules that analyze aspects of the MEV activity and holder distributions of a token. Please consider contributing to one of the four bounties pinned below. 

New module proposals can be made in the Discussions tab [here](https://github.com/orgs/alpha-dragon-org/discussions).
